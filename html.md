## What is HTML?

[Wikipedia definition:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

> `Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)` is the standard **markup language** for creating web pages and web applications.

* Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. 

> **HTML describes the structure of a web page**.

[Markup Language Wikipedia definition:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)

* The current HTML version is [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

> A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. Instructions are expressed directly by tags.

This weekend’s result makes Ryan Coogler’s Marvel sensation only the fourth film to earn $100 million in its second weekend, along with “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” “Jurassic World” and “The Avengers.”
Of those, only “The Force Awakens” had a better second weekend.

Finaly, this is how the news HTML code looks like:

## Tag Structure

* As HTML is a markup lenguage we'll use tags to create HTML elements that will show the user the different document sections and content.
* A tag will have the following parts:
  * The `<` character defines the initial part of our tag
  * Then well add the `tagname` that we want to use
  * At the end we'll use the `>` character
  * We can call this void or empty element as it doesn't have any content
```html
<tagname>
```

* There're other tags that will have content
* To add content we just write it after the `>` character

```html
<tagname>Content of our tag
```

* In this case the first tag is working as an opening one
* We need to close this structure to let the browser know that we finished definening this structure
* Closing tags are pretty similar to the opening ones but with a minor difference
* Add a `/` character after the `<` and the tagname

```html
<tagname>Content of our tag</tagname>
```

* We can write this in a different format too
* Using [identation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_(typesetting)) it's a good practice when we code as it allows us to see complex structures in a simpler way

```html
<tagname>
  Content of our tag
</tagname>
```

* We have 2 different types of tags:
  * Void or empty - just 1 tag
  * With content - need the opening and closing tags

### Tag attribute
* Tag attributes are additional values that configure the tags or adjust their behavior in various ways to meet the criteria the users want.
* The attributes will have an attribute name and a value
```html
attribute="value"
```
* Attributes are part of the tag

```html
<tagname attribute="value">

<tagname attribute="value">Content of our tag</tagname>
```

* HTML defines elements attributes
* Some attributes are global
* We can add an id attribute to any HTML element

```html
<tagname id="first-element">

<tagname id="second-element">Content of our tag</tagname>
```

### Tag with tags!
* Also, we can have tags as content from other tags:

```html
<tagname>
  <tagname>Hi I'm a title</tagname>
  <tagname>
</tagname>
```

* Using tags inside other tags we can create more complex structures
* This looks great but it doesn't make sense as all the tags have the same name

## HTML Tags
* Now that we know how tags works we only need to know the HTML tags names and attributes
* Check the MDN site to se a complete list of [HTML elements reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

## HTML document structure
* The first tag we'll learn is the DOCTYPE tag
* It's an empty tag as it doesn't have content
* By using this tag the browser knows the version of HTML that we are using
* The browser won't render this tag

### HTML5 Doctype
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```
### HTML
* The **html** element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.
* [MDN html doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)

```html
<html></html>
```

### HEAD
* The **head** element provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to its scripts and style sheets.
* [MDN head doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head)

```html
<head></head>
```

### Title
* The Title element defines the title of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. It can only contain text, and any tags contained within are ignored.
* It's part of the **head** element
* [MDN title doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)

```html
<head>
  <title>Document title!</title>
</head>
```

### BODY
* The **body** Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.
* We can write any content or other HTML elements between the html tags
* [MDN body doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body)

```html
<body></body>
```

### Basic HTML file

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Text inside the HTML body tag
  </body>
</html>
```

#### Practice
[Exercise 1](exercises/html/ex_01.md)

### Heading Elements
* HTML has 6 title levels
* The title tag name is the letter **h** and the title number (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)
* By default the browser will show the h1 much bigger than the h6
* It's a good practice to respect the titles order by Hierarchy
* [MDN heading elements doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements)

**Example:**
```html
<h1>Main title</h1>
<h2>Secondary title</h2>
<h3>Other title</h3>
<h4>Other title</h4>
<h5>Other title</h5>
<h6>Other title</h6>
```

### Paragraph
* The **p** tagname represents a paragraph
* This tag accepts content so we'll have an open and close tags
* The paragraph tag is a `block element`
* By default the browser will show block elements one below the other
* The browser will render only a space chracter even if we write many
* We can use &nbsp; [HTML entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity) to display the space character
* [MDN paragraph doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)

**Ejemplo**
```html
<p>Paragraph content.</p>
<p>Paragraph          content.</p>
<p>Text with some &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces</p>
```
